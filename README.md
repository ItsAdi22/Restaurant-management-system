# Hello guys this is my first ever project I created in my second year in flask framework.

## This project is free to use and anyone can contribute to it | Just give me credits `:)`

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

### Installation:

- git clone this repo
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create a file called `.env` and copy contents of `.env.example` in it. `(website wont run without this file)`
- fill mysql database details in your `.env` file
- fill up email authentication details in `.env` (optional but might get error)
- import the demo sql file provided

# ---------------------------------------------------------------


### Note: <span style="color:red">You must create an account at stripe.com and get your api keys! </span>
### <span style="color:red"> Also Note: Admin account needs to be verified before accessing the dashboard **(therefore you will need to setup smpt!)** </span>


### Usage:
- go to this address `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` or `yourdomain.com`
- Admin panel: `127.0.0.1/admin` or `localhost/admin` or `yourcomain.com/admin`

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

Issues:
  - No implementation of csrf tokens
